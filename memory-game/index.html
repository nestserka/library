    <h1>Lucky's whack a cancer game</h1>
    <!-- <section class="introduction">
        <h2 class="game-introduction">What is this game about?</h2>
        <p>Have you heard about <q>Whac-A-Mole</q> game? The rules are simple: your goal is to whack a mole fast when his hat lights up, and/or he makes his special sound.</p>
        <img src="img/game_explanation.png" alt="game-explanation">
        <p>This summer my dog (his name is Lucky, but seems he is not that lucky) got cancer. So instead of hitting the mole, I decided to change the game a bit.</p>
        <p>In the given time your goal is to hit as many cancer-cells as you can and save Lucky. Each hit will bring you 2 points.</p>
        <p>Sounds easy? I agree. But you must be careful. Sometimes Lucky pops up to checks what you are doing. If you hit him by mistake â€” you will lose 5 points</p>
