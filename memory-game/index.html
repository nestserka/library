        <h2 class="game-introduction">What is this game about?</h2>
        <p>Have you heard about <q>Whac-A-Mole</q> game? The rules are simple: your goal is to whack a mole fast when his hat lights up, and/or he makes his special sound.</p>
        <div class="new-rules">

            <div>
            <p>This summer my dog (his name is Lucky, but seems he is not that lucky) got cancer. So instead of hitting the mole, I decided to change the game a bit.</p>
            <p>In the given time your goal is to hit as many <span>cancer-cells</span> as only you can and save Lucky. Each hit will bring you 2 points.</p>
            <p>You must score at least <span>30 points</span> and get <span>the highest</span> to win this game!</p>
           </div>
        </div>
        <p>Sounds easy? I agree. But you must be careful. Sometimes Lucky pops up to checks what you are doing. If you hit him by mistake â€” you will lose 5 points</p>
